If you are setting up by cloning, please remove the "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox" and "@typechain/hardhat" packages from the package.json because they might not install correctly due to different package versions. After removing them, make sure to add "--force install" at the end to forcefully install all the packages.

---

These packages will help you in both small and large projects. They will assist you in testing, generating code coverage, determining contract size, and calculating contract gas fees/prices in USD.

<h1> If you want to set up the app from scratch, follow these steps: </h1>

# Install Packages with Latest Version of Hardhat and Openzeppelin

<b> Create Package.json file </b>

    npm init -y

<b> Or Clean Cache </b>

    npm cache clean --force

<b> Dependencies </b>

    npm install --save

    npm install --save-dev hardhat  @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades

    npm install --save @openzeppelin/contracts

---

# For Hardhat Setps

    npx hardhat

<b> Choose script, I choose Typescript </b>
<b> Add .git ignore </b>
<b> No need to install hardhat-toolbox, we already install </b>

<h2> you can remove the existing contracts, testing files, and scripts from the project and replace them with your own contracts, tests, and scripts. </h2>

<b> Make sure to update your Hardhat configuration and create a .env file, You can refer to the example .env file provided and make the necessary updates to your own .env file and the Hardhat configuration file based on your network specifications.</b>

<p> ETHERSCAN_API_KEY </p>: <span> You will get the ETHERSCAN API KEY from etherscan.io, for which you need to log in to etherscan.io. After logging in, go to the "https://etherscan.io/myapikey" website and create your API key there. </span>
<p> ALCHEMY_GOERLI_API_KEY </p>: <span> You can get the ALCHEMY GOERLI API KEY either from Alchemy or create it from Infura. You have the option to create an API key from Alchemy based on your network preferences by visiting https://dashboard.alchemy.com/. Moreover, you can also use Alchemy's "faucet" feature to get test Ether for your Goerli network or other network. </span>
<p> PRIVATE_KEY </p>: <span> You can obtain your private key from your public address in MetaMask. </span>

# Then, Test your Smart contract

    npx hardhat clean

    npx hardhat compile

    npx hardhat test

    npx hardhat coverage

<b> After Successfully run test case you can use this setup as per you code/contract <b>
